For a comparison between GForce 3800 and Nanoray light 18i definitely go for GForce if the price is less than nanoray. Both racket are best for offensive players that plays on back of the court. One of the con of this racket is the grip size because Li-Ning rackets has lower grip size. You can add external grips on this racket to make it easily movable. I give 5 stars to this racket because of the quality (Military Grade Corbon) and the string tention that is 30 for best performance and max-to-max 32 lbs. That's it \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42 I love this racket also Blue,Brown colous is the best ever racket colour I saw.",

            "Bought the laptop with very high expectations. Been an HP user since a long time. But this time, I'm utterly disappointed. Got delivered a laptop but the sound output was tooooo low for a laptop costing 1lakh+ After chasing HP for 2 weeks since the day of delivery, finally got a replacement. Sound was a little better this time than the previous one, but compared to the product I saw at offline store, sound was still very low. Then after a few days, i noticed a manufacturing defect in the display. Bezels were not fit properly and the body is making noises upon opening or closing the laptop. Raised ticket with HP, been 2 weeks now, no tech visit done yet. The speaker mesh on the top is dummy. Sound is from bottom speaker only. The FN lock button does not exist. You need to keep holding FN button to perform functions. Terrible experience.",
            "Pros- 1. Great design 2. Awesome screen 3. Snappy performance Cons- 1. I was expecting better battery life since this is a Evo laptop. Right now it is around 5hrs. 2. I was also expecting louder speakers given they are top firing.",

Cinebench R23 Score 9144pts (Multi Core), 1366pts (Single Core). Good Build Quality. A clean install of windows is highly recommended to remove bloatware and also update to the latest BIOS to improve speed and stability. The display colors were on the warmer side, you can easily change it in the Radeon software, I've set it to 7400. The display has contrast ratio of 1000:1.",

            "Go for it , Display is awesome. Sound is really good, Asus AI Noise Cancelling Feature is too good.",
            "This laptop has a fantastic display and performs very well. I have been using it for the past 2 months. Haven't noticed any lag or stuttering...works pretty well. I have played heavy games like Assassin's creed odessys and GTA V, it runs them smoothly and at very high graphics quality. The fps could have been at 120hz instead of 60hz but the oled display makes up for it. The battery life is around 5 and half to 6 hours on basic usage. If you use heavy applications, it will last around 4 hours. Overall, at this price, I would recommend this laptop. A laptop with RTX 3050, i5 12th gen and OLED display at 85k is a pretty good deal.",
            "Value for money.",

            "first of all it is a very well built laptop. I'm in love with this laptop. but for the price I think it is over priced. the performance is good but not but not ultimate, but time some bugs and lags have been faced but I think that its a windows bug. the weight is well distributed so it makes it easy to carry but the edges of the laptop are sharp so it is very uncomfortable to rest the hand on the edges and also uncomfortable to carry. then hinge quality is decent it can be opened with open hand but while typing it wobbles little bit and makes it uncomfortable. then about the display, it is the main reason for me to buy this laptop for this price, it is great and color accurate and detailed and 4k videos streaming in this is a delight but it is very glare a display so it makes it very annoying. the fan doesn't name noise. the type C port doesn't charge faster. still i didn't performed any GPU oriented tasks but I think that it could handle that. the keyboard experience is very decent and also same with the trackpad. the ASUS link app makes it handy to share files from windows to phone but it is not optimized. if you are a student or a professional and searching for a laptop with this specs and should look professional and light weighted then you can consider this laptop.\u2764\ufe0f",
            "Capable product for coding, multitasking and gaming with good battery backup.",
            "The thing is the display is only 60Hz make sure u r okay with it. Good nits of brightness ,but It's been little annoying that it's glossy not antiglare.the light reflection is littles disturbing to work on it .if it's a deal breaker for u then u should go for ips- anti galre display I've seen Vivobook 16x in Asus store website around 79k is best replacement for this.if u r in not direct sun Light entering room it's fine. Battery is pretty good.over all nice product.",

            "Pros: 1) extra slot for 2.5 hdd is available. 2) light weight considering for a gaming laptop. 3)Great design 4) good quality compared to my old lenovo g580 5) office applications and other normal work would give 3hrs I think on full charge. Cons: 1) only One fan and so heating would be an issue if fan is set to 100%.. But may be want to 150% which is noisy 2)keyboard is not a full one 3)Can't play game for a full hour.. Battery will die. 4)power button is not giving tactile feedback 5)Very prone to oily or wet hands which would defiantly leave matk on metal cover on top and keyboard areas, Suggesting a vinyl skin. On top. 6) If you are into mainly gaming, might want to buy an extra active cooling pad. 7) 1650 is for basic gaming note it. PuBG plays well\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb 8) display is not Ips, only ips level. Red is not gonna view good. Verdict : light weight laptop for occasional or light game users as well as good performance i5. If gamming is only concern go for Bravo15 which has two fans and slight better battery i think but at a slight increase in weight.I wanted light weight.",
            "Gaming is just osm and it is best for Daily usage. I have tried GTA V just one problem that is little heat but mind-blowing product.",
            "Well the laptop is quite good for some specific uses and it could suit you better if you know what kind of laptop you actually want.",
            "Overall good but battery drain quickly",
            "Product Is Good For Me Right Now I will esit review after longtime Usage with Pros and Cons.",
            "Good to use for normal computer things like working, surfing, listening music or to play light games . Because once you start playing heavy games like COD, or Warfare .. the laptop heats to the top level where it can burn your hand, fan speed noise irritates and battery dont lasts for long. so not recommended for gaming and dont write its a gaming laptop.. its just normal general fast performance laptop. I am unsatisfied because my purpose was to play high definition games but I am not able to play even for an hr due to excess heating.",
            "My second MSI laptop. MSI never disappointed me ever. Amazing performance and budget friendly,and no other company beat the build quality. One is the reason I fell in love with that. Blindly go for it.",

            "It's a satisfactory product from Samsung, which delivers good performance, superb display, good cameras, and great battery life. If you are not looking for a fancy design or so-called premium glass design, then you might be disappointed. Design is elegant and resembles high-end Samsung phones. I purchased an electric black variant and must say I loved it. \ud83d\ude0d The water drop notch is not a deal breaker for me. Display brightness and quality is great, Samsung never disappoints in display. This phone has 6000 Mah battery still it feels light and so comfortable. Battery life is stable and great. When I received this phone, it had 53% battery charge available. I used this from 6 pm to 11 pm, setting up, installing apps from backup, and then watching a movie. The phone ran continuously without getting warm or getting hung. At 11 p.m., the battery remaining after 5 hours of use was 29%. I was so happy. I was worried about the performance of exynos 1280, but I must say this delivers well in the midrange segment. It's consistent and doesn't get warm after normal usage. The main cameras are good, but the other two are average. I would recommend this phone for everyone who wants to purchase a good phone under 20k Rupees. Wait for sale and offers. If you can get it for some discount or with some exchange offer, it may come down to around 15k to 16k, and at this price, this is awesome.",
            "Product is good. And it's pros and cons are as follows :-- Pros:-- 1.Very good haptic 2.This phone have one ui 5.1 which is the best ui till I used 3.It has only one speaker but sound is loud and quality is also Ok 4.Its 5g connectivity is very good 5. Front camera is so good Average:-- 1. Performance is average 2. Selfie camera is also average 3.Battery performance is average according to 6000 mah Cons:-- 1.

            "This is my review after 19 days. Lts start with the DESIGN *Its awesome. Looks really good in Wight. Slim and sleek , looks premium, with cases too. PERFORMANCE *the snapdragon 695 is an efficiency based chipset. It can squeeze out maximum performance with less battery usage. But it can compete with snapdragon 750g and 778 in performance base too. Only thing missing out is 4k video recording. Gaming is good. I got 60 fps in all the games I tried. It can even run jenshin impact pretty decent , so nothing to discuss more CAMERA *the 50 mp OIS is good. Only if you know how to use it. There are a lot goons out there reviewing that it's bad . It's just they don't know how to use it. The manual mode in camera is good , can shoot decent photos too. But the real thing is taking advantage of the software. You can just install Google cam and can shoot and record like a pixel does. It's awesome I'll share some examples DISPLAY *The 10 bit OLED is a banger. The colours are rich and vibrant. Movie experience is awesome BATTERY *the 5000 mah is an overkill lol. It's been 19 days since I bought it. I ve never charged when battery is under 20% more than once. You can easily use without charging for 2days in a medium usage AUDIO PERFORMANCE * I am big fan of movies and anime. So audio and visual is important to me, it's one of the main reasons why I bought this phone . But im slightly disappointed. I know it's got Dolby. Because of the Dolby got a fixed preset , and we can't adjust the equilizer. . But the audio quality is good though. I used to have a old Lenovo it had Dolby in it . It was better than this. But the Loud speakers are the best. awesome quality and surround sounds . And the haptic feedback is cool. too many block heads said it's vibrating while playing sounds. They probably don't know what's haptic feed back is . HEATING Phone doesn't heat much , only while intense gaming that is. And it's mildly too. The only drawback I saw is bad quality with earphone audio quality. And im statisfied with phone . Worth the money go for it",
            "Very good phone for normal users. 1.Display quality no1 2.battery backup super 3.camera ok not that bad... As reviews 4.sd695 super. 5.android13 update and 3yeras update",
            "Superb phone. I think the best combination would be with 8 gb ram. For camera use G Cam Mod, works superb with the hardware provided. Photography experience will become awesome. Battery experience is the best. I always feel what's the point of buying an expensive chip which can't last a half day atleast to experience it. Here the battery will last more than 10 hours, since the chip is working well. Just we have to keep check on what we are installing and what background processes those are invoking. If you keep a track of your settings then nothing will hamper the battery experience. The processor is very nice. I can play cod on high and very high settings with no issues. 2 times out 50 times there could be a lag. But that's it. The rest of the work is smooth enough under it. 8 Gb is the perfect match for it. Software experience is the Selling Point of this phone. Hence, it's smooth, Clean and interesting. 90% optimised. Very very rarely software creates problems. Display is so good ilon the eye. 1080p is good enough for me. I don't watch 2k>= content so no issues.",
            "This is one phone which gives value for money, p oled display looks great, and the camera was awesome. Battery backup was ok but I wish it could be better, turbo charging helps to charge the phone quickly, phone can run on a single charge for the whole day if you are a medium user.",
            "Cons\u2935\ufe0f *Only one major Android update is not enough. *The back panel vibrates a lot while playing anything on speaker. *Performance of wide angle camera and micro camera is below zero even main lens is not up to the mark but you can fix it by GoogleCamera Mod *MGC_8.4.600_A10_V13_MGC.apk* Pros\u2935\ufe0f *The user interface is best in the class even better than those phones costing 60k to 70k. *The display is just amazing I know that it won't support HDR Plus and 4K videos Play back but still better than those devices that support 4K and HDR+. *The stereo speaker on this device is just fine not to mention back panel vibration.",
            "Must buy. Very nice product phone performance is very good Awesome screen Good battery life",
            "Nice phone with different features. I switched from samsung note 8 to Moto g82. Display looks great and very light to hold. I love it. Battery life looks good Camera is fine but not that great. Overall good phone for regular use. Edited on 3/11/22- Camera is worst in terms of selfie. Can't take pics in night. Could have gone for some other brand \ud83e\udd72",
            "Well apart from the camera being decent, Motorola has a fantastic job with this phone in my opinion. Display is top-notch, battery is top-notch, performance and software experience is top-notch. Stereo speakers are impressive because they do have good bass. These were the only things I was seeking and finding them here being done so perfectly really makes me glad. There really isn't any fault that I could find with it except for the camera; that was a little disappointing because it doesn't feel like a 50MP until you're out in a lot of sunlight however the night vision mode is surprisingly good. The phone is very light and smooth which is again something I personally wanted. All in all, I'm very happy with this device.",
            "Verry good parformance. Inside box u get moto g82 hand set with cover One 33w charger with cable and one sim ejector pin Details of product reviews: Camera is good 3.5/5 Performance is verry good 5/5 Battery is also 5/5 Sound is Waooo 5/5 Display Picture quality is decent 5/5 Over all Design lookup is super and light weight 5/5 Worth buying product \ud83d\ude0a",
            "This phone is a value for money product. Let's start with the best part the \"display\" . it's simply gorgeous. Accompanied with a loud stereo speakers it is a very good device for media consumption. camera is average but we can edit it and make it good in google photos. performance is so smooth with that 120hz. i'm charging the phone for one time per day. If we change the refresh rate to 60hz we can expect even better battery life. At last the hero of the phone the \"software\". The stock android is a pleasure to use. it's so refined and well polished , looks better than all chinese phones' UI. Add on we have \"headphone jack\" and SD card slot for our memories . i'm not a big gamer but i played some games like asphalt and lost in harmony they run smooth too. We can easily choose this phone over other chinese counterparts ."

            "Never expected this from Samsung. No adapter, no case was still OK, but performance wise it's a real disappointment. While fingerprint sensor is fine, phone's touch lags, many a time you have to tap twice to open an app. When three finger screenshot is best you are bound to press power and sound button simultaneously to take screen shot, don't know if Samsung has made those buttons that sturdy for quick and repeated use. Camera quality is not upto the mark, whether front or rear. Design is same orthodox and RAM plus feature remains a mystery. Phone lags a lot, most importantly don't rely on Flipkart's exchange offer of product being picked after 10 days, it's complete fraud. After 10 days they are telling there was nothing like this.",

            "Camera quality is so so so poor",

            "The delivery boy who has to give the thing was very helpful. If I had taken the RELAME company phone earlier, I would not have given the back cover and the top cover of the mobile but this time I was very happy to get it. However, it would have been better to give headphones to listen to music. CAMERA : After taking still pictures, I realized that the quality of the camera is good. I looked at the specification before buying the phone and thought there was no wide angle. I WAS WRONG. If you go to the More option of the camera, you will get the movie option. There is a facility to shoot video at wide angle inside that movie option. CHARGE : I would greatly benefit from a fast phone charging system. EXCHANGE VALUE: The exchange value of my old phone that is available is just fine CONS : There is no option to record the call. OVERALL REVIEW : THANK YOU FLIPKART THAK YOU RELME NARZO.",

            "Let me tell you the genuine review of the device with my 6 observations.I keep it short to make you understand easily : 1-If you want decent performance then choose this dimensity 800U same in X7 works smoothly without lags and can be your daily driver. 2-If you don't bother amoled display. 3-If you want 120Hz fast refresh rate. 4-If u think 5000Mah is sufficient to you. 5- If you like realme Ui 6-If u play too much games and prefer headfone jack over wireless bts. That's all.I haven't attached any pictures because actual pics won't tell you the real story because you people must be heard of proverb : \"All that glitters are not gold\".",
